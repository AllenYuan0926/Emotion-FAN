## Visualization
We visulize the weights of attention module in the picture. The blue bars represent the ***self-attention weights*** and orange bars the ***final weights*** (the weights combine ***self-attention*** and ***relation-attention*** ).

Both weights can reflect the importance of frames. Comparing the blue and orange bars, the final weights of our FAN can assign higher weights to the more obvious face frames, while self-attention module could assign high weights on some obscure face frames. This explains why adding relation-attention boost performance.
 
## Download pretrain models
We share two model of **ResNet18**, include a model pretrained in **MS-Celeb-1M** and another in **FER+**.

## Demo AFEW
Training with self-attention
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python Demo_AFEW_Attention.py --at_type 0
```
Training with relation-attention
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python Demo_AFEW_Attention.py --at_type 1
```
#### Options
* ``` --lr ```: initial learning rate
* ``` --at_type ```: 0 is self-attention; 1 is relation-attention
* ``` --epochs ```: number of total epochs to run
* ``` --momentum ```: momentum
* ``` --weight-decay ```: weight decay (default: 1e-4)
* ``` -e ```: evaluate model on validation set
* etc.
